# 1 . 密码学原理
>[!info] 按照计算机出现前后划分为古典密码学 Classical Cryptography 和现代密码学 Modern Cryptography，其中从古代到近代大概可划分为 7 代加密法
## Gen 1 - 隐藏法 Concealment Method
## Gen 2 - 凯撒加密法 Caesar Cipher
## Gen 3 - Vigenère cipher
## Gen 4 - Enigma cipher
## Gen 5 - Lucifer cipher
## Gen 6 - RSA
## Gen 7 - Quantum encryption

# 3 . Mining data analysis
Hashrate ( Ehash. Thash…)
Mining machine hashrate (S 19 pro, 100 T+)
Mining difficulty (52.35 T, change 2016 blocks: 2 weeks )
Network hashrate
Known pools hashrate
Energy efficiency ratio
Electricity cost

## 3.1. Usd D to calculate Networkhashrate
D* 2^32/H=time
If  time=10 min=600 s
Difficulty = 52.35 Thash
52.35 x 2^32 ÷1000000÷600=Network Hashrate=374.735 Ehash
But Knowpools is different
